# Project-1

# Resource files

There are three jupyter notebook files in the solution. 
Data wrangling solution  : BOM\WebScrape_BOM_Weather_Data.ipynb
Demand Analysis Solution : Electricity Demand Analysis.ipynb
Demand Weather Analysis  : Electricity Demand Vs Weather Analysis.ipynb

Resource :
For Data wrangling solution, BOM\Resources\Weather folder will contain all the extracted weather data and BOM\Resources\stations.csv and BOM\Resources\VIC_Station_List.txt will contain weather station data.

## Installation

Run the BOM\WebScrape_BOM_Weather_Data.ipynb solution first to extract the weather data.
Then run Electricity Demand Analysis.ipynb and Electricity Demand Vs Weather Analysis.ipynb to analyse the extracted data.
